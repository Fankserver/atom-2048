## Installation
You can install `atom-2048` either use the Atom package manager, which can be found in the Settings view, or run `apm install atom-2048` from the command line.

## How to play
After installation, you can find the toggle in menu `Packages -> atom-2048`, or you can simple press `ctrl-alt-a` to toggle the view.

Once the view is loaded as demonstrated in the gif animation above, you can play the game simply as you are in a browser. You'll see your high scores, and you can reset the game by hit `spacebar`. Go wild!

NOTE: all the directions arrows can cause the cursor move around the editor view, so they are disabled in `atom-2048`, you can use `WASD` keys or `vim` keys to move the tiles!
