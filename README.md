Playing the interesting 2048 game right inside atom.

![2048-in-atom](https://raw.github.com/void-main/atom-2048/master/2048-in-atom.gif)

## Installation
You can install `atom-2048` either use the Atom package manager, which can be found in the Settings view, or run `apm install atom-2048` from the command line.

## How to play
### The normal way
After installation, you can find the toggle in menu `Packages -> atom-2048`, or you can simple press `ctrl-alt-a` to start and stop the game.

Once the view is loaded as demonstrated in the gif animation above, you can play the game simply as you are in a browser. You'll see your high scores, and you can reset the game by hit `spacebar`. Go wild!

NOTE: all the directions arrows can cause the cursor move around the editor view, so they are disabled in `atom-2048`, you can use `WASD` keys or `vim` keys to move the tiles!

### boss-is-coming mode!
We all know what `boss-is-coming` mode is! :P 

While playing the game, you simply hit `b` (for `back` or `boss` or whatever you can remember), and everything will be gone! But don't worry, your progress is not destoryed. Wherever you feel safe, simple press `ctrl-alt-b`, and everything will show up again.  A little heads up, if you accidentally hit `ctrl-alt-a`, your progress will not be preserved, so, use carefully!

## Change Log
- 1.0.0 Initial full transplanted game
- 1.1.0 Add `boss-is-coming` mode as proposed by [@christhekeele](https://github.com/christhekeele) in issue [#1](https://github.com/void-main/atom-2048/issues/1)
